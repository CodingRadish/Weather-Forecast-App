# Weather Forecast App

This repository contains a very basic setup of an AngularJS app for viewing the weather forecast of a chosen city. The data is obtained through the [Open-Meteo weather forecast API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs).

## UI

The app has a very simple UI implemented. The idea was to display all of the neccessary information as simply and concisely as possible.
